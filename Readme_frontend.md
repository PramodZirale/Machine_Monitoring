Frontend Application - Machine Monitoring Dashboard

This is the front-end portion of a machine monitoring dashboard that visualizes real-time data using Vue 3, PrimeVue, and Chart.js. The dashboard includes features like real-time line charts, editable tables, and parameter tracking.

Features

- Real-time data visualization using Chart.js
- Interactive, editable tables using Vue 3 components
- Real-time chart updates with smooth user experience
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Throttling and graceful error handling for smoother performance

Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher) and npm (v6 or higher)
- Vue CLI (optional, but helpful for local development)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/machine-monitoring-frontend.git
   cd machine-monitoring-frontend

2. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

Project Structure

The main files and folders you’ll work with are:

- src/components/
  - LineChart.vue: Component for displaying real-time line charts using Chart.js.
  - Table.vue: Component for displaying an editable table of parameters and values.
  - AppMainLayout.vue: The main layout for the dashboard.
  
- src/views/Dashboard.vue
  - Contains the core logic for the dashboard, including fetching data and updating charts and tables.

- public/:
  - Contains the static files (index.html, favicon, etc.)

Running the Application

1. Development Mode:

   Start the development server:

   npm run serve

   The app will be available at http://localhost:8080.

2. Production Build:

   To create an optimized production build:

   npm run build

   This will generate the production files in the dist/ folder.

API Integration

The app is designed to work with a RESTful API (which you’ll be building as the backend). Make sure the backend API is running and accessible at the configured endpoints in your environment.

Default API endpoint used:

- /api/machine_io/: For fetching and updating machine IO data.
- /api/get/machine_io/top10/: For retrieving top 10 parameter data for the charts.

Modify the API endpoint URLs if your backend is running on a different port or location.

Customization

If you need to modify the chart logic or table behavior:

1. Chart Customization:
   - You can adjust the chart appearance or update throttling in LineChart.vue.

2. Table Customization:
   - Modify the editable fields or validation logic in Table.vue.

Environment Variables

You can configure environment variables in the .env file (optional). Add any custom configurations like API URLs here:

VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

Make sure to load the correct URL for your API during development and production.

Technologies Used

- Vue 3: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Chart.js: A flexible charting library used to create the dynamic line charts.
- PrimeVue: A UI component library for Vue.js applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive layouts.

Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated error handling and logging for API requests.
- Add more chart types (e.g., bar charts or pie charts) for different kinds of parameter tracking.
- Enhance mobile responsiveness.
